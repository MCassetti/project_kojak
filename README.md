# Project Kojak

The aim of this project is to provide you with the right meme for the occasion. This would include authentically captioned memes in real time
depending on the context of a user's conversation or text. This is like gify but with memes 



Objective: Meme autocomplete for infinite lols

Approach: Meme generation was already done using bidirectional LSTM with attention with some pretty awesome results (see this paper https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/reports/6909159.pdf)however, I wish to implement reinforcement learning to generate more believable captions. Additionally, it would be interesting to do a follow up project


Tools: Having struggled with pytorch in the last project, I will continue using pytorch. 

 
Data set: Initially, 5-20 memes with captions scrapped from memes as well as some of my own user provided text captions.
If I plan on generating the images of the memes then my data set will need to be much larger, perhaps all the available memes.
Of course, memes come from unexpected sources, such as unexpected and funny facial expressions, so this may take some
thought as to what kind of images can be generated.
